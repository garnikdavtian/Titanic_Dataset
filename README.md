Titanic Survival Prediction Project
In this project, I analyzed the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival probabilities, demonstrating a range of essential data science and machine learning techniques. My workflow included:

Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering: Dropped non-informative columns, encoded categorical variables, and addressed missing values to ensure data quality.
Class Imbalance Strategy: Applied advanced techniques, including the use of XGBoost, to tackle class imbalance effectively.
Modeling and Evaluation: Built models with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and a Neural Network using Keras, optimizing each for accuracy and interpretability. Evaluated model performance with accuracy scores, ROC-AUC, and Precision-Recall analysis.
Visualization: Created visual insights with feature coefficient plots, ROC, Lift, and Precision-Recall curves to interpret model behavior and feature impact
